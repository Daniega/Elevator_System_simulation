# Elevator System simulation
A Program written in Python language to simulate elevator system in a building. <br />
The program calculates average waiting time of K People until they all arrive to desired floor. <br />
In this program I used N Elevators, M Floors and K People (user can choose). <br />
W/O GUI, I used Python console.
